# Project Overview

I developed this project to improve myself in Computer Vision. I created my own dataset for training the model, used OpenCV for capturing the camera and YOLOv8 model to train.

# DATASET

I took 70~ photos of my chessboard and pieces from different angles. I labeled each chess-pieces and chessboard one by one and created my Dataset %80 for training, %10 for testing and %10 for validating.

# Training
I used googlecolab for training the model because of their powerful GPU.

This project is still under development. I want to add AI feature to show user the best possible move they can make.
